## Technologies used
- HTML
- CSS (flexbox)
- Git/GitHub

## Why did I build this project?
I built this application so I could have a place to display my recent development work to potential employers/clients.


## What did I learn?
I learned how to use flexbox to style multiple flex containers with differing card sizes. I learned how to make my components responsive to browser size. These two things proved very challenging when dealing with many nested child elements in each flex container.

## Features
- Global nav with links to each site section
- Sections to tell clients/employers about me, my work, and how to reach me
- a grid of flexbox cards for my recent dev projects that are clickable and bring users to my published git pages

## How to install this application
- No installation is required to use this web application. Simply navigate to the url in your favorite web browser (not compatible with Internet Explorer)

## How to use this application
- Navigate to https://collin-beisel-tm.github.io/fullstack-portfolio/
- scroll down to learn about me or click the global nav button to reach your desired section
- Project cards in the 'My Work' section are clickable and will take you to the deployed application on GitHub pages. If the project is not yet complete the link will take you to my GitHub profile
- Click the email link in the 'Reach Out' section or fill out the form to get in touch with me
